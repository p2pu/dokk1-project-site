faq:
- q: Why are you doing this work?
  a: |
        The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the global blueprint for building a better and more sustainable future for all, and yet much work remains to be done to achieve the goals. With a commitment to serving the public and providing access to information, public libraries are extremely well suited to advance the goals of the SDGs for people of all ages. We are developing resources, partnerships, and methodologies that allow libraries around the world to run creative and engaging peer-learning programs that bring us closer to one another, and to a sustainable future for all.

- q: What is a learning circle?
  a: |
        The learning circle methodology, as refined by Peer 2 Peer University, is rooted in equitable, community-based approaches to education. Learning circles combine the flexibility and access of informal education, with the scaffolded, peer nature of formal education. Not only are learning circles free to create and free to participate in, but they embody the very values of the SDG program: everybody is a teacher and a learner, education can lead to collective action, co-constructing a learning experience is itself a way to build knowledge and create the world that you want to live in. Learning circles fundamentally shift the balance of power in a group setting, away from teacher/student, first world/third world, and create authentic spaces for collaboration and participation. This model is an essential value to teach and co-construct SDGs.

- q: How can I get involved?

- q: What learning materials can be used in learning circles?
  a: |
    Most learning circles use a free, online course as the basis of study. While P2PU creates some courses, the vast majority of materials come from other organizations around the web. You are welcome to use any course you would like for a learning circle, so long as it is free for participants and not in violation of the terms of service of the course provider. A complete list of courses currently being used by learning circle facilitators is available at https://www.p2pu.org/courses/

- q: What personal information do I need to provide to participate?
  a: |
    Learning circle participants do not need to create an account with Peer 2 Peer University. You can sign up for a learning circle with your name and phone number and/or email address. This information is only used by your facilitator to contact you. If you would like to create a learning circle, then you need to create a P2PU account. Additional questions related to user privacy can be answered by contacting support@p2pu.org.

- q: Does it cost money to participate in a learning circle?
  a: No, learning circles are free to participate in.

- q: Do I get any certificate at the end of the learning circle?
  a: P2PU is not a university and does not offer any accredited degree certificates. Some of the online courses that are used in learning circles have degree and/or certificates, but many of these are not free. If you would like a certificate demonstrating the completion of your learning circle, this is possible if you speak with your facilitator.
